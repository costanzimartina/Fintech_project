## Introduction 



- **Problems with the current Car Insurance Market** 


This project aims to address some problems in the car insurance field and to propose a new way to manage this huge business based on a blockchain system and smart contracts. 

The current insurance market presents many negative and controversial aspects that lead to customer dissatisfaction. Just to mention some problems, the price of a car insurance may vary a lot depending on several factors, but in general, considering the fact that the user does not perceive a tangible value or a real experience from it, a car insurance may seem very expensive. Furthermore the process and the contracts themselves can be highly complex and far away from a user-friendly experience and on top of this it can be very easy for an insurance company to write contracts in their favour. 
Just to provide you with some data, despite the fact that a car insurance can be very expensive the chances of getting paid out by an insurance are at 5% and it is not even clear how much is covered, moreover just 60%-70% of premia are spent on damages, the 20% is spent on sales an the remaining percentage on the other kind of costs. 
From the other side, in defence of insurance companies, the system allows - very often - opportunities to play the system and exploit betterment. Therefore a solution that leverages transparency and the safeness is needed and it can improve both the customer experience, reducing the costs and and making the refunding procedure faster and more efficient, and the internal operations of insurance companies, that can reduce costs related to frauds that according to the FBI the total damages of insurance fraud exceed $40 billion per year (considering all type of insurances) and they can also streamline the procedure reducing the operating costs. 

##ADDING DATA ######
Due to recent technological development, the insurance market falls under the rader for a technological advancement. The apparent issues make rum for InsurTech startups that attempt to disrupt the market with digitalized systems and blockchain technologies that seem particularly suitable in order to address the previous mentioned problems. ``maybe some more numbers here``

#ADDING DATA AND SOME COMPETITORS, WHATâ€™S GOING ON IN THE SYSTEM??? ####
Despite the high initial investment cost for blockchain based systems ``source needed here again to back this up`` , the first real world implementations are going to market in the beginning of 2020. Established by a cooperation of insurances and ``       `` , *B3i* is building a platform on distributed ledger technology to  create a "single source of truth" opposing to decentralized and obscure data systems. The ambition is to be able to optimise the  processes in the market  and reduce the costs significantly. This first implementaiton will be applied in the reinsurance market, due to ``.... find on website again``.

2. Projectgoals

The propose of our project is to propose a solution that aims to solve different problems in the procedure that start from the creation of a car insurance contract to the expiration of the contract itself, passing through the management of a car accident and all the related practices. The major goal and the focus is on making the procedure more efficient and safe in order to reduce the operating costs an the costs related to frauds.

####Solving the contract 



- Main Idea to solve mentioned issues 
- Scrutinise the process (tasks of the nodes, authentication etc.)
- Assess Proposal and what has been done 
- Explain the code in the smart contract
