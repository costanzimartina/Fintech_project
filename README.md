Progress about project

### We met the fisrt time all the team on 25/11/2019

We discuss about the project and we decide the main idea of our project.
We sketch it on a paper that it is also available under the name of firs_sketch
in the folder Projectprogress. Every one also upload every information in the repository 
with the reference or.

We also agree that we are going to work all together and that we are going to discuss every single part.
We also discuss how to procede and how to divide the different tasks.

In the repository you will have:
- A folder with progress of the coding part
- A folder with the progress and all the notes in word-style that every one can upload or download 
- A Report that every one can edit 
(- we also aim to do brief ppt)



### first commit -- Vittorio Colombo
The code inside Insurance.txt is the first raw version of the Police Report. The contract contains information such as:
  - first vehicle
  - second vehicle
  - who's fault is
  - damage amount
  - the owner of the contract (aka the police)
  - the time in which the contract was deployed
  
Only the Police can modify the existing contract, I have done it via the modfifier OnlyOwner. In fact, if you deploy the contract 
using one account, and then switch to another and try to modify values stored inside it, it will raise an error.

### We met the second time all the team on 2/12/2019
We discuss about the next steps and we decide together the index of our report and then we started to write it.
Vittorio and I (Martina) will focus more on the coding part and Sharlyn, Mirko and Paula will focus more on the report. But every one knows what's going on and everyone gives his or her contribution to both parts.
