## Current Situation 

**Problems of Insurances**

- Too expensive (60-70% of premia spent on damages, ~20 % for sales)

- Too confusing (no obvious ongoing tangible value / experience)

- - Maybe keep it simple?

- **Too easy to game the     system** **(adverse selection; contracts often written in favor of     insurers)**

- **Cash drain** **(only 5% of people ever get paid out by an insurance)**

- Doesn't cover everything (exclusions, deductibles)

- **Doesn't cover everyone** **(large     population groups uninsured, > 50%)**

The current problems of insurances 

**Problems of the Market**

\-    Insuretech start ups cannot establish in the market, but incumbent firms cannot adapt new technologies 

 

## About sensors to process data

\-    Possible solution to gather unbiased data

\-    Needs to be addressed with care since fraud cannot be excluded

\-    telematics solutions e.g. https://www.octotelematics.com/telematics-solutions/insurance-telematics-solutions/

o  analysis of driving behavior

o  distraction monitoring 

 

## Other InsurTech companies

 

## **Lemonade**

\-    Taking a fixed fee (e.g. 20% ), not a provision 

o  No matter how much the insurance pays out, the bottom line stays the same 

\-    *Application for us:* Implementing in the smart contract that the left over money does not go to the customer or the insurance firm but to a certified source à erase the incentive for an insurance company to fight losses 

\-    Reinsurance to cover for amounts that exceeds the pool 

 

#### How to process a claim

\-    Lemonade: did it based on research for example in behavioural economics etc. 

\-    Decide on what is handled automatically and what goes further à reducing the time and the workload à smart contract implementation could be used to decide what goes through to human consideration 

 

 

## **B3i**

\-    building a platform on distributed ledger technology to eliminate the duplication of data “**single source of truth”**

\-    Create a DLT based network through the adoption of standardised systems and protocols 

\-    Through the network, enable the market to optimise processes and capital allocation and generate significant cost savings 

\-    Offer network users a variety of integrated applications from B3i and partners 

\-    First application on the reinsurance market  

#### Key features 

\-    In a **Distributed Ledger**, each node processes and verifies every item, thereby generating a record of each item and creating a consensus on each item's veracity. A distributed ledger can be used to record static data, such as a registry, and dynamic data, i.e., transactions.

\-    **Smart Contracts** are capable of automatically validating a condition and it will automatically determine whether an 'asset' should go to a nominee or back to source, or a combination thereof. As part of the process the decentralised ledger also stores and replicates the document ensuring security and immutability.

\-    **Immutability** is the ability for a Blockchain ledger to remain a permanent, indelible, and unalterable history of transactions. Crucially immutability has the added benefit of ensuring trust and integrity to the data businesses record everyday.

\-    **Consensus** ensures relevant information is shared to only defined parties across a node; effectively only parties involved in a contract have access to the same information as it is updated.

\-    **Secure** distributed ledger technology ensures greater security for transactions on the node due to its decentralised nature and immutability.
