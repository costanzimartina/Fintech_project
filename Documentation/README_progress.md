Progress about project

### We met the first time all the team on 25/11/2019
We discuss about the project and we decide the main idea of our project.
We sketch it on a paper that it is also available under the name of firs_sketch
in the folder Projectprogress. Every one also upload every information in the repository 
with the reference or.

We also agree that we are going to work all together and that we are going to discuss every single part.
We also discuss how to procede and how to divide the different tasks.

In the repository you will have:
- A folder with progress of the coding part
- A folder with the progress and all the notes in word-style that every one can upload or download 
- A Report that every one can edit 
- A txt file in which we write all the references
- A txt in which at end we will write the contribution of each person, but I am sure 
that everyone will contribute to every part of this project
(- we also aim to do brief ppt)


### We met the second time all the team on 2/12/2019
We discuss about the next steps and we decide together the index of our report and then we started to write it.
Vittorio and I (Martina) will focus more on the coding part and Sharlyn,Mirko and Paula will focus more on the report. But every one knows what's going on and everyone gives his or her contribution to both parts, and I will try to coordinate everything at my best.
