Progress about the project

### We met the first time all the team on 25/11/2019
We discussed about the project and we decided the main idea of our project.
We sketched it on paper, this sketch is available in the repository under the name of firs_sketch, in the folder Projectprogress. Every one also uploaded every information in the repository with the reference or.

We also agreed that we are going to work all together and that we are going to discuss every single part.
We also discussed how to proceed and how to divide the different tasks.

In the repository you will find:
- A folder outlining the progress of the coding part.
- A folder ProjectProgress with the progress and all the notes that every one can upload or download .
- A Report that every one can edit from which we take the information to write the slides.
- A txt file in which we write all the references.
- A txt in which at end we will write the contribution of each person.
- A shared ppt presentation.


### We met the second time all the team on 2/12/2019
We discussed about the next steps and we decided together the index of our report, and then we started to write it.
Vittorio and I (Martina) will focus more on the coding part while Sharlyn, Mirko and Paula will focus more on the report. But every one knows what's going on and everyone gives his or her contribution to both parts, and I will try to coordinate everything at my best.
